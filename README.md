Welcome to my nook of the digital world! I am an environmentalist currently aspiring to transition into software engineering as a self-taught programmer. Although this marks the humble beginning of my journey, I have an insatiable drive to constantly learn and grow. ðŸŒ±  My passion for coding lies in ultimately creating useful applications that will add value, establish meaningful user impact, or reshape the future of social justice and sustainability.
