Welcome to my nook of the digital world! I am an environmentalist currently aspiring to transition into software engineering as a self-taught programmer. Although this marks the humble beginning of my journey, I have an insatiable drive to constantly learn and grow. ðŸŒ±  My passion for coding lies in ultimately creating useful applications that will add value, establish meaningful user impact, or reshape the future of social justice and sustainability.

Courtesy of Dr. Rongzhong Li and the brilliant folks at <a href="https://github.com/PetoiCamp">Petoi</a>, I am currently in the midst of assembling and programming an adorable open-source robot cat named Nybble.  One of my goals is to improve my programming skills enough to the point where I can contribute to my first open source project and learn from others.  More importantly, this <i>pawsome</i> robot cat will be the <i>purrfect</i> <s>distraction</s> companion for my feline...so she doesn't feel compelled to <s>disrupt</s> aid in my coding efforts.
