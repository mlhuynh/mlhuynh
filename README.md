Welcome to my nook of the digital world! I am an environmentalist currently aspiring to transition into software engineering. Although this marks the humble beginning of my journey, I have an insatiable drive to learn and grow. ðŸŒ±  Currently, I am a student at Ada Developers Academy. My passion for coding lies in ultimately creating useful applications that will add value or establish meaningful user impact. In further developing my programming skills, I hope to reshape the future intersection of tech, social justice, and sustainability someday.
